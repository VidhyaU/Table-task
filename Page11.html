    <p>Yoga is the ancient way to attain physical, mental, and spiritual practice. Primarily originating in India, the word 'yoga' is derived from Sanskrit, meaning to unite. This unity signifies the ultimate union of the body with consciousness and thus attaining definitive peace.
       Recognizing the universal appeal of Yoga, on December 11 2014, the United Nations proclaimed June 21 to be marked as the International Day of Yoga.
       It was first started by our present Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. He celebrated Yoga Day for the first time on June 21 in 2015, after which Yoga Day started being celebrated all over the world on June 15, and it turned into International Yoga Day. Since then, Yoga Day has been celebrated every year by the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) in India.
       As per the calendar, this date is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and the shortest in the Southern Hemisphere. Also, from the Yoga's perspective, this summer solstice marks the transition to Dakshinayana. Dakshinayana is the six-month tenure for the sun to travel to the south on the celestial sphere in between the Summer and the Winter solstice.
       In today's times, this is practised in various forms across different parts of the world and is growing more and more popular. The main aim of celebrating International Day of Yoga is to raise awareness of the multitude of benefits of Yoga. However, Yoga is much more than just a mere physical activity.</p>
